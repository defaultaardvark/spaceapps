Spaceapps Version Control

The primary goal of this application is to notify a user in real time if they approach too closely to a known COVID-19 
infection hotspot.

Hotspot location and intensity are determined by data provided by known, curated sources (in our case, Johns Hopkins) that updates
at least once a day. The current approach is to obtain large CSV files containing latitude and longitude coordinates, but 
should be upgraded to use a web scraper eventually.
